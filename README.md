# weekend-react-gallery

_Durationn: 3 days_ 

## Description
A gallery to store and share flora images was requested. This gallery allows visitors to click an image to reveal a description. The visitor may also like images. The total number of likes can be seen on the page. 

## Installation


1. Create a database named `react_gallery`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm run server` in your terminal
5. Run `npm run client` in your terminal
6. The `npm run client` command will open up a new browser tab for you!


#Usage

1. Once the application is open visitors can view any shared images.
2. Visitors may indicate they love the image by clicking the "Love This Image" button. When the button is clicked the  additional like is added to the "Love This Image" count under the button. 
3. Visitors can hover over an image to reveal that it is clickable.
4. When the image is clicked the image is replaced with a description of the image. The visitor can click the description to bring back the image.
